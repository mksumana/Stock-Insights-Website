    Why Invest in Stocks?    
    Investing in stocks offers an opportunity to grow your wealth over time, outpacing the rate of inflation and achieving financial goals. 
    Unlike other investment options, stocks come with several advantages like:
    <ul>
      <li>    Ownership: When you buy stocks, you become a shareholder in the company. You share in the profits, and your voice can influence important decisions through voting rights.</li>
      <li>    Liquidity: Stocks are highly liquid investments, which means you can buy or sell them easily, making it convenient to access your money when needed.</li>
      <li>    Diversification: By investing in a variety of stocks, you can spread risk across different companies and industries, reducing the impact of any single company's performance on your portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
